# VS Code Solarized Theme

Based on Ryan Olson's [solarized theme](https://github.com/ryanolsonx/vscode-solarized-theme), I've made a version for people like myself who want the bare minimal syntax highlighting.

After install, the themes are called 'Solarized Monochrome Light' and 'Solarized Monochrome Dark'.
